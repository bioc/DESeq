2010-04-29: version 1.1.1

- added "variance adjustment factors" in order to allow for manual scaling
  of the raw variance estimate in case that the residual ECDF plots indicate
  a bad fit
  
- fixed a bug which caused the resVarB column of the data frame returned
  by nbinomTest to be wrong
  
- changed the scvPlot function to now show conditions rather than raw variance
  functions
  
- changed the way how 'rawVarFunc' interpretes its second argument

- updated the vignette
