2010-06-02: version 1.1.6

- changed arguments for estimateVarianceFunctionsin preparation for a planned new
  feature; instead of pool=FALSE or pool=TRUE, use method="normal" or 
  method="blind".

2010-06-01: version 1.1.5

- fixed a small bug that caused p values to sometimes slighly exceed 1.0
  due to rounding errors

2010-05-15: version 1.1.4

- corrected a serious documentation bug: the effect of the variance
  adjustment factors was described the wrong way round

- changed scvPlot: now does a bias correction by default

2010-05-06: version 1.1.3

- added a CITATION file

2010-05-03: version 1.1.2

- replaced the C function to calculate the p values. The new version is now
  a bit more conservative with its approximation, trying to ensure that p values
  are always rather approximated as too high. Furthermore, it considers the
  values 0 and kS as critical points, too, which makes a difference at very 
  high overdispersion.
  
- changed the default value for the accuracy guidance 'eps' from 3e-3 to 1e-4, as
  the former seemed to have been a bit too high. (The approximation broke down
  in rare cases.)
  
- The 'eps' parameter is now exposed in 'nbinomTest' as well.    

2010-04-29: version 1.1.1

- added "variance adjustment factors" in order to allow for manual scaling
  of the raw variance estimate in case that the residual ECDF plots indicate
  a bad fit
  
- fixed a bug which caused the resVarB column of the data frame returned
  by nbinomTest to be wrong
  
- changed the scvPlot function to now show conditions rather than raw variance
  functions
  
- changed the way how 'rawVarFunc' interprets its second argument

- updated the vignette
